# AI-Powered Mental Health RCT – Data Processor

This tool processes participant data for the randomized controlled trial:

> **"A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Integrated Digital Mental Health Platform: Evaluating Resilience, Habits, Physiological Regulation, and Emotional Awareness"**

The platform integrates evidence-based frameworks from:
- **[Habit Design Studio](https://habit-designer.aiwaapp.live)**: Designing habits that work *with your brain*, not against it (Nguyen, 2024)
- **[Well-Be](https://wellbe.aiwaapp.live)**: HRV-derived wellness metrics (Stress, Energy, Resilience, Balance, Coherence, RMSSD, SDNN, Total Power)

## ✨ Features

- Generates **300 participants** across 3 arms:  
  - `Full_Platform` (with HRV biofeedback)  
  - `Active_Control` (no HRV)  
  - `Waitlist`
    
- Outputs **3 CSV files**:
  - `Participants_Data.csv`
  - `HRV_Metrics.csv`
  - `Post_Intervention_Outcomes.csv`
- Runs **entirely in your browser** – no installation or internet required after download

## 🧠 Scientific Basis

- **Habit Design**: Reflects Fogg’s core philosophy of sustainable behavior change through tiny, anchored habits that honor cognitive diversity (e.g., ADHD)  
- **HRV Metrics**: Aligns with Welltory’s 4-step research cycle and validated indices:
  - **Stress**, **Energy**, **Productivity**, **Resilience**, **Balance**, **Coherence**
  - Physiological markers: **RMSSD**, **SDNN**, **Total Power**
